            <h4>Journey 0: Gotta go fast!</h4>
            <hr>

            <p>By the end of this journey, you'll have a development environment that lets you get into your mod with a simple hotkey.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, having minimal time between making a change and seeing results is the secret sauce of an enjoyable software project. By putting in a little bit of effort upfront, you'll be able to iterate on your mod quickly and avoid wasting time. It may seem like it only takes a little bit of time to package and run your project manually, but it adds up!</p>

                    This lesson is Windows-specific, but the concepts will apply to any system. If you're on Mac or Linux, I recommend doing some <a href="https://google.com">research</a> to see what's available to speed up your workflow. Please let me know what you find and I'll update this guide.

            <p>If you get stuck anywhere along the way, <a href="https://github.com/coderTrevor/DRG-modding-tutorial-project/releases/download/Journey_0/Journey_0_Complete.zip">here</a> is how my project folder looks after completing this journey.
                Note that you'll need to change <span class="code">DRGModdingAutomationScripts\Configs\LocalConfig.ini</span> to match the UE4 and DRG install paths on your system.</p>

            <h5>Part 1: Setting up <a href="https://github.com/DRG-Modding/FSD-Template">FSD-Template</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/DRG-Modding/DRGModdingAutomationScripts">DRG modding automation scripts</a></h5>

            <p>These repositories will do all of the heavy-lifting of setting up a project and getting it packaged and running quickly. Follow the instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/DRG-Modding/FSD-Template">FSD-Template</a> GitHub page to get started.</p>
            <br>
            <h6>Part 1a: Get the files onto your local machine.</h6>
            <p>I think most of my audience is probably comfortable navigating GitHub and checking out projects. If that's not the case, let me know and I'll expand this section.</p>
            <br>
            <h6>Part 1b: Configure DRG modding automation scripts.</h6>

            <p>This is really easy. First, navigate to your project folder and then open <span class="code">DRGModdingAutomationScripts\UtilityBats</span> and then run <span class="code">MakeDefaultConfigFiles.bat</span>.</span></p>
            <p>Next, go up one folder and open <span class="code">Configs\LocalConfig.ini</span> in your favorite text editor.</p>

            <p>Change the first line to <span class="code">ProjectFile=..\FSD.uproject</span>. Change the next two lines as needed. On my system, the file ends up looking like this:</p>
            <div class="code">ProjectFile=..\FSD.uproject
UnrealEngineLocation=C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.27\
SteamInstall=C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deep Rock Galactic\</div>

            <p>Now, go back to the <span class="code">DRGModdingAutomationScripts</span> directory and run <span class="code">QuickTestMod.bat</span>. When you see <span class="code">(F = file, D = directory)?</span> press "f". You should now see your mod launched!</p>

            <h5>Part 2: Using <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a> to launch your mod with a hotkey</h5>

            <p>Download and install <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/download/">AutoHotkey</a> version 1.1. Then, download and save <a href="files/QuickLaunch.ahk">this file</a> to your project directory.</p> For reference, here's the contents of this script:<div class="code">; The next four lines are providing by AHK when creating a new script
#NoEnv ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
#Warn ; Enable warnings to assist with detecting common errors.
SendMode Input ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%\DRGModdingAutomationScripts ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.

; This allows the script to be edited more easily while it's running. Ctrl-s will save it and reload it.
~^s::
	reload
return

; If the active window belongs to the Unreal Editor
#IfWinActive ahk_class UnrealWindow
	; Respond to win-p
	#p::
		; Assume the name of the folder this script is in describes the project and present a
		; traytip to the user saying this project is being packed.
		SplitPath, A_ScriptDir, dir,
		TrayTip, Packing, %dir%
		; Use DRGModdingAutomationScripts to pack and run the script
		Run, QuickTestMod.bat
		WinWaitActive ahk_class ConsoleWindowClass
		Send f

		; When the console window closes, stop displaying the tray tip
		WinWaitNotActive ahk_class ConsoleWindowClass
		TrayTip
	return
            </div>

            <p>When this script is running and the Unreal Editor is open, you can hold the windows key and press p and your mod will immediately be packed and launched!</p>

            <div class="card">
                <div class="card-content">
                    I chose win-p as the hotkey in part because it doesn't do anything in the Unreal Editor. You can change the script and choose any hotkey you want. Check the <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm#s2">help for AutoHotkey</a> for more information on defining hotkeys.
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>A final note about Autohotkey - It's really cool and I encourage you to learn how to use it to automate your other tasks. However, with its functionality comes some downsides. It's a popular choice among cheaters, so I should let you know that <strong>if you find you can't launch some of your favorite games</strong>, check to make sure this script isn't running and exit it by right-clicking on the "H" icon in the taskbar.</p>

            <h5>That's it! I hope you'll enjoy being able to quickly iterate on your mods with next to no effort. Check out the next journey when we get to some actual modding.</h5>
