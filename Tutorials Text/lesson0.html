            <h3>CoderTrevor's Adventures in Deep Rock Galactic Modding</h3>

            <h4>Journey 0: Gotta go fast!</h4>
            <hr>

            <p>By the end of this journey, you'll have a development environment that lets you get into your mod with a simple hotkey.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, having minimal time between making a change and seeing results is the secret sauce of an enjoyable software project. By putting in a little bit of effort upfront, you'll be able to iterate on your mod quickly and avoid wasting time. It may seem like it only takes a little bit of time to package and run your project manually, but it adds up!</p>

                    This lesson is Windows-specific, but the concepts will apply to any system. If you're on Mac or Linux, I recommend doing some <a href="https://google.com">research</a> and seeing what's available to speed up your workflow. Please let me know what you find and I'll update this guide.

            <h5>Part 1: Setting up <a href="https://github.com/DRG-Modding/FSD-Template">FSD-Template</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/DRG-Modding/DRGModdingAutomationScripts">DRG modding automation scripts</a></h5>

            <p>These repositories will do all of the heavy-lifting of setting up a project and getting it packaged and running quickly. Follow the instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/DRG-Modding/FSD-Template">FSD-Template</a> GitHub page to get started.</p>
            <br>
            <h6>Part 1a: Get the files onto your local machine.</h6>
            <p>I think most of my audience is probably comfortable navigating GitHub and checking out projects. If that's not the case, let me know and I'll expand this section.</p>
            <br>
            <h6>Part 1b: Configure DRG modding automation scripts.</h6>

            <p>This is really easy. First, navigate to your project folder and then open <span class="code">DRGModdingAutomationScripts\UtilityBats</span> and then run <span class="code">MakeDefaultConfigFiles.bat</span>.</span></p>
            <p>Next, go up one folder and open <span class="code">Configs\LocalConfig.ini</span> in your favorite text editor.</p>

            <p>Change the first line to <span class="code">ProjectFile=..\FSD.uproject</span>. Change the next two lines as needed. On my system, the file ends up looking like this:</p>
            <div class="code">ProjectFile=..\FSD.uproject
UnrealEngineLocation=C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.27\
SteamInstall=C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deep Rock Galactic\</div>

            <p>Now, go back to the <span class="code">DRGModdingAutomationScripts</span> directory and run <span class="code">QuickTestMod.bat</span>. When you see <span class="code">(F = file, D = directory)?</span> press "f". You should now see your mod launched!</p>

            <h5>Part 2: Using <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a> to launch your mod with a hotkey</h5>

            <p>Download and install <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/download/">AutoHotkey</a>. Then, download and save <a href="files/QuickLaunch.ahk">this file</a> to your project directory.</p> For reference, here's the contents of this script:<div class="code">; The next four lines are providing by AHK when creating a new script
#NoEnv ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
#Warn ; Enable warnings to assist with detecting common errors.
SendMode Input ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%\DRGModdingAutomationScripts ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.

; If the active window belongs to the Unreal Editor
#IfWinActive ahk_class UnrealWindow
    ; Respond to ctrl-p
    ^p::
        Run, QuickTestMod.bat
        WinWaitActive ahk_class ConsoleWindowClass
        Send f
    return
            </div>

            <p>When this script is running and the Unreal Editor is open, you can press ctrl-p and your mod will immediately be packed and launched!</p>

            <p>A final note about Autohotkey - It's really cool and I encourage you to learn how to use it to automate your other tasks. However, with its functionality comes some downsides. It's a popular choice among cheaters, so I should let you know that <strong>if you find you can't launch some of your favorite games</strong>, check to make sure this script isn't running and exit it by right-clicking on the "H" icon in the taskbar.</p>

            <br>
            <h5>That's it! I hope you'll enjoy being able to launch your mods with next to no effort. Check out the next journey when we get to some actual modding.</h5>
